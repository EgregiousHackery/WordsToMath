# WordsToMath
An initiative to collect "number sentences," for the purpose of teaching AI to accurately extract mathematical information from the spoken/written word.

## What?
We'd like people to add number-containing sentences to this repository. As many different number-containing statements and instructions as you can dream up! Also include a pronunciation guide. We want to know two things:

1) What are you saying?
2) How would you speak it aloud?

## How about some examples?
* "I have three siblings."
* "What's 127,612 (a hundred and twenty seven thousand six hundred twelve) plus 24% (twenty four percent)?"
* "How many games did the Knicks win in 2018-19 (twenty eighteen nineteen), and was that some kind of record for losses?"
* "What's the change from $6.80 (six eighty) out of ten?"

Please note that all numbers have "pronunciation" guides, except when self-explanatory. We want to know *exactly* what you would say if you were speaking this aloud. If you'd have pronounced 2018-19 as "twenty eighteen through nineteen," that's what we'd like to know. If you'd have pronounced "$6.80" as "six dollars and eighty cents," cool! Whatever you write, let us know how *you* say it.

If you don't say it the same way every time, add a double entry, but please don't shove two "pronunciation guides" into one entry!

**Three good entries:**
  * "272 (two seventy two)"
  * "272 (two hundred seventy two)"
  * "272 (two hundred and seventy two)"

**One bad entry:** "272 (two seventy two/two hundred seventy two/two hundred and seventy two)"

You might also have noticed, in the second example, that there are many, *many* other ways to phrase 127,612:
* one hundred twenty seven thousand six hundred twelve
* one twenty seven six twelve
* a hundred twenty seven thousand six hundred and twelve

and we've still only scratched the surface. There are so many ways a person could pronounce 127,612! We want them all, and we want much more complex examples.

## Why?
Because virtual assistants are the future! This repo's original contributors are also contributors to [Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai/), the open-source voice assistant. We like writing language parsers. We hope to use this data to write fancy parsers, handling every conceivable way to express a number.

In practice, the "127,612" example seems relatively easy, but you never know what other people are going to come up with. Slang, mannerisms, personal preferences, language is an awesome beast, and we need your help to tackle it!

## How? This is just a README
I'm writing this during my break, so Watch This Space. If ideas are pouring out of you, and you don't want to wait, feel free to open an issue. We'll migrate the data once the page is a Page.

## Couldn't we do this with ML?
Yeah! Somebody Else's Department can take care of that.
